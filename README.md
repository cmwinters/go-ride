# Go ride (a bike)

This repo has awesome bicycle routes that you can download to your computer. Currently, all the routes are from [bestrides.org](http://bestrides.org/). I made this repo because all the routes on that site are hosted on Map My Ride, which I find to be cumbersome and not very useful. Most cyclists I know prefer Strava and a dedicated head unit. I've exported some of the routes on bestrides to GPX, which is platform agnostic and easy to import to the tool you prefer.

I plan on cleaning up the markup a bit and adding more routes as time goes on. Anyway, enjoy!
